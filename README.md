# Dent

`dent` is a library and command-line tool for summarizing and comparing small
samples of numerical data. In particular, it aims to support the comparison of
microbenchmark results. It is heavily inspired by the BSD
[`ministat`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=ministat) tool by
Poul-Henning Kamp. The primary goal is to provide a simple, focused interface
that is numerically reliable and can be reused in various forms of development
tooling.
